# Apple-Carbon-Neutral 2030
## Description:
1. Apple plans to cut emissions by 75% from 2015 levels by 2030, with the remaining 25% (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) offset through carbon removal, aiming for net zero emissions.
2. 2030 Emissions Target Outlook:
The forecast indicates that Apple is on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target and may even exceed it, potentially reducing the need for carbon offsets.
3. Carbon Offset Progress and 2030 Gap:
Apple's carbon offset efforts are increasing, but to achieve the 2030 net zero target, they must significantly scale up their initiatives to cover the remaining 4.3 million metric tons CO2e gap. This involves both further reducing emissions and expanding offset programs.
